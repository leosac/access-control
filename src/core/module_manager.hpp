* A second module manager that loads "ZMQ aware" module -- modules that talks to the

* No reference to an object is returned when loading a module. The module will lives
* in its own thread and other components
* can talk to it.
*
* @note: Only the ModuleManager object has "direct access" to the module object. It
* is zmqpp::actor that launches the module
* in its own thread.
*
* @note: Use the "level" property to define module initialization order.
* This initialization order is mandatory, and the lower the value is, the sooner the
