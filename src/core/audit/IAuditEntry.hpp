 * This interface is inherited by all "behavior specific" audit object, such as

 * happens to a user.
 *
 * There are 2 main reasons for using an interface here:
 *     + It reduces the required include for files that will use Audit object.
 *       Indeed, only the interface file and the AuditFactory header are required.
 *       No need to include various ODB headers.
 *     + Allows us the use of factory function to create Audit object. This provides
 *       stronger garantee against bugs, as part of the object lifecycle is
 *       managed the factory function.
