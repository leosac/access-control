/**
* This class provides an API to collect the configuration of a remote Leosac unit.
*
* This class is wrapped by the Tasks::FetchRemoteConfig object.
* The implementation is a BLOCKING collection (with timeout), which is why one should
* use the Task object that wraps the collection.
*
* #### Consistency concerns (and solutions):
*
* Fetching the remote configuration requires multiple messages: 1 for the global
* configuration, and one per modules, at least. There is no "remote locking", which
* means that it is possible for the remote configuration to change while we are
* fetching it.
*
* Fortunately, there is a global `version` field that represents the version of the
* whole configuration. This number can only increase. What we do is similar to
* Optimistic Concurrency Control: we fetch the configuration version once before
* retrieving the configuration, then we fetch it again when we are done. If the
* number is the same, it means that the configuration didn't change.
