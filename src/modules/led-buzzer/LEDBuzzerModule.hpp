/**
* Namespace where implementation of Led (or buzzer) support is done.
*
* While LED are basically a GPIO, this module is here to provide "higher level"
* construct to LED device, like BLINKing.
* For simple command (`ON`, `OFF`, `TOGGLE`) it simply forwards them to the backend
* GPIO device that is linked with the
* led, so it does not provide very useful addition.
* However, For blinking (which requires multiple command, with varying delay) it's
* pretty useful.
*
* Since logical buzzer (that you can toggle on or off) work in the same way, this
* modules
* handles both.
*
* @see @ref mod_ledbuzzer_main for end-user documentation.
