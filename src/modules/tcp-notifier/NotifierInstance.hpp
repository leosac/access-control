 * This is an instance of the Notifier. The module can have

 *
 * A instance is qualified by its status (server or client) and
 * the protocol it speaks.
 *
 *
 * @note Implementation note about peer management.
 * When acting as a server, we remove a disconnected client from
 * our targets_ (list of peer), and we create a new target when a client
 * connects.
 * When acting as a client, we always keep the list of server we connect
 * to,
 * and manage the state (connected or not).
