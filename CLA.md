# Contributor License Agreement.

*The document below clarifies the terms under which You, the person listed below, may make "Contributions" (software, bug fixes, configuration changes, documentation, or any other materials) to the project at [https://github.com/leosac/leosac](https://github.com/leosac/leosac). This license protects You, [Leosac](http://www.leosac.com) and licensees; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose. Please complete the following information about You and the Contributions. If you have questions about these terms, please [contact us](mailto:support@leosac.com).*

## You and Leosac agree:

You grant to Leosac a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicenseable, transferable license under all of Your relevant intellectual property rights (including copyright, patent, and any other rights), to use, copy, prepare derivative works of, distribute and publicly perform and display the Contributions on any licensing terms, including without limitation:

open source licenses like the AGPL license;
binary, proprietary, or commercial licenses.
Except for the licenses granted herein, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to the Contribution.

You are able to grant us these rights. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If Your employer has rights to intellectual property that You create, You represent that You have received permission to make the Contributions on behalf of that employer, or that Your employer has waived such rights for the Contributions.

The Contributions are your original work. You represent that the Contributions are Your original works of authorship, and to Your knowledge, no other person claims, or has the right to claim, any right in any invention or patent related to the Contributions. You also represent that You are not legally obligated, whether by entering into an agreement or otherwise, in any way that conflicts with the terms of this license. For example, if you have signed an agreement requiring you to assign the intellectual property rights in the Contributions to an employer or customer, that would conflict with the terms of this license.

We determine the code that is in our project. You understand that the decision to include the Contribution in any project or source repository is entirely that of the Leosac team, and this agreement does not guarantee that the Contributions will be included in any product.

No Implied Warranties. Leosac acknowledges that, except as explicitly described in this Agreement, the Contribution is provided on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
